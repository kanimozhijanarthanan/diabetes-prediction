# Diabetes Prediction with Machine Learning Algorithms

This project utilizes various machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on health metrics. The algorithms used include Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest.

## Overview

Diabetes is a prevalent chronic disease affecting millions worldwide. Early detection and intervention are crucial for managing diabetes effectively. This project aims to provide a predictive tool that can assist healthcare professionals in identifying individuals at risk of developing diabetes.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains health metrics such as glucose concentration, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin level, BMI, age, and diabetes status.

## Usage

To utilize this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-prediction.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the main script:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## Results

The performance of each algorithm will be displayed in the console or saved to a file, depending on the implementation. The results will include metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
